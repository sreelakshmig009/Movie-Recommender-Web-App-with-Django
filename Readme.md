### Steps to run the Web App in your local ystem

After forking the main repository move to Django projects folder and follow the below the steps.

#### Create and start a a virtual environment

```
virtualenv env --no-site-packages
source env/bin/activate
```

```

```
Then again enter the same password for confirmation.

```

Superuser will be created successfully

#### Make database migrations

Django has sqlite database by default. If you want you can use any sql or nosql database too. In this project I have used sqlite db.

```
python manage.py makemigrations movierecommender
```
Then run 
```
python manage.py migrate
```
#### Start the development server

To run the web app,run
```
python manage.py runserver
```
And open localhost:8000 and navigate to /movierecommender to see the running app or /admin to open the django administration

```
127.0.0.1:8000/movierecommender 
```
or 
```
127.0.0.1:8000/admin
```
